# House Price Prediction with Tree-Based Models and a Stacked Ensemble

This project predicts house prices using tree-based machine learning models and a stacked ensemble approach.

Methods:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting
- Stacking ensemble model
- Model evaluation using cross-validation

Tools:
- R (tidyverse, tidymodels, ranger, xgboost, stacks)

Goal:
Demonstrate applied machine learning for structured economic data with a focus on predictive performance and model comparison.
